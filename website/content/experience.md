## Software Developer

::subtitle
Fuzed | November 2023 - Present (:duration{ start="2023-11" })
::

At **Fuzed** (previously known as **Codefined**), I contribute in developing an innovative, **cloud-based ERP** system tailored for the **food production industry**.

With the rebranding, our focus shifted from custom software development to creating a comprehensive solution that streamlines production processes.

- **Technology stack**
  
  - Back-end: **.NET**, **ABP Framework**, **EF Core**, **SignalR**
  - Front-end: **Angular**, **Nx monorepo**, **Bootstrap 5**, **NgRx**, **RxJS**, **Signals**

- **Module development**
  
  Built core modules like **CRM**, **Product management**, **Supply chain** (Purchase, Sales, Distribution, Invoicing), **WMS** and **Translations**. We've also built an external B2B portal.

- **Infrastructure**

  Utilized tools and technologies like **SQL Server**, **Azure Storage**, **RabbitMQ**, **Redis**, **Kubernetes**, **Grafana**, and **SonarQube** to ensure a robust and scalable system.

- **Integrations**

  Integrated with 3rd party apps like **Exact Online**, **Checkin@work** (NSSO), **Transus** (EDI) and **Dokapi** (Peppol).

- **DevOps**
  
  Managed **DevOps** tasks, including configuring and maintaining **CI/CD** pipelines using **Azure DevOps**. Actively worked with **Azure services** such as **Kubernetes services**, **SQL databases**, **Key vaults**, **Storage accounts**, and **Container registries**, while also managing the **Kubernetes dev cluster** for development and testing purposes.

By integrating modern technologies and industry-specific requirements, I help shape Fuzed into a comprehensive, industry-ready solution that simplifies complex production activities for the food industry.
