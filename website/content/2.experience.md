## Analyst Developer @ aariXa

#### July 2017 - April 2021 (:duration{start="2017-07" end="2021-04"})

aariXaâ€™s development stack includes: Angular, .NET Core, MS SQL,
Azure, Windows Server, ... so mainly focused on Microsoft technologies.

I have been working on a new Cloud Native, realtime, multi-tenant web
app hosted as microservices which run in Docker containers as an
in-house developer.

I have migrated aariXa's existing Dynamics CRM 2011 to a new .NET based CRM package and customized the CRM with new business logic.

As one of the few in-house developers, I've also been doing some DevOps and system administration. Moving existing applications to new containers or virtual machines, but also monitoring and maintaining aariXa's infrastructure.
